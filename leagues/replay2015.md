## Tournament

Each week is a new session of 4 rounds. Each round, players are grouped into 3 or 4 player groups, and play a game of pinball on a randomly drawn table.
Players are awarded 7,5,3, and 1 points, respectively, based on their finish on the game. 

All players will play 4 games a night - your score for the night is the sum of your points from the four games. 

Tourney start at 7:00 sharp! We may not be able to check players in late, so please be prompt. 

No coin drop! Machines will be set to free play from 5pm to 11pm.

## Finals 

Finals:
Each week you will collect league points based on your finishing results. 
Weeks you do not attend count as 0. 

Your final score is the sum of all the weeks, dropping your lowest two scores. 

The finals will take the place of the last weeks tournament.

IFPA WPPR points will be awarded for your performance across the entire season. 

Finals Format:

The top 16 players qualify for finals. In the event that a qualified player does not attend, the next highest qualified player will be considered qualified. 

Details of the final playoff format will be announced closer to the date.
