##FINALS:
Finals are for CASH only. IFPA points are based on regular season play only. 

The finals format is TBD but likely similar to how the 2015 Pub 340 League 2015 finals were done. A reverse ladder.

## Entry Fees and Prize Pool

Entry - **$10** / event ($3 towards games / $7 towards prize pool)

**Max 42 players** per event. 

Games will not be set on free play but tournament games will be plugged.

No cash prizes day of event. Prize pool goes towards the top 10 at the end of the season.

There will be day of prizes from our sponsors though - Beer prizes from Big Rock and Strange Fellows (for day of prizes) Prizes from Landyachtz and whoever else.

Prize pool STARTS at **$750** ($250 donated from Pub 340, $250 donated from East Van Amusements, $250 donated from Landyachtz)

Top 10 to 12 people get cash prizes at year end depending on how large pot is. 

Payouts will not be heavily weighted towards the top 3 players as some standard breakdowns seen in pinball tournaments, sharing the money is better! Money will be spread out more between all players of the top 10-12.

Stay tuned for more info.
