## Tournament

Each week is a 2-strike tournament using Brackelope. Each round, matches are drawn at random with players with the same number of strikes, and assigned a table as they become available. Each match is two players, a single game, and the losing player recieved a strike. Players with two strikes are eliminated from later rounds, but can continue to play for fun. Rounds continue until all but one player has two strikes. 

Tourney start at 7:00 sharp! We can't check players in late, so please be prompt. 

No coin drop! Machines will be set to free play from 5pm to 11pm.

## Finals 

Finals:
Each week we will award league points based on players finishing results. First place will receive (number of players that week + 3) points. Second receives (number of players that week +1). Third receives (number of players that week), every finish below receives 1 fewer point. Ties take up the number of tied players spots, and split the award.

Your score for qualifying is the sum of your best 15 weeks.(of the 18). Weeks you don't attend count as 0.
