   A pinball league held at <a href="http://landyachtz.com/Contact_Us">Landyachtz Factory Store</a>. Hosted by Kyle Seller. 
</p>

Welcome to the Landyachtz pinball summer series!

This is intended to be a fun, social league, loosely based on the 2015 Pub 340 Pinball league. There is more randomness, and less seriousness in these leagues. We donâ€™t like to have people waiting around for matches, so most events are designed for quick play, little waiting and a start to finish time in 2 to 2.5 hours.

See the [Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/462512400585343/) for questions and more details!

##DETAILS:

8$ at the door.

$4.00 covers your tournament games while $4.00 goes into the league pool pot. The league pot will start at $75 along with prizes donated by Landyachtz. Note: You still need to pay for practice games. 

The store closes at 7PM, so we will have the arcade solely for league players at that time onwards!

1 mulligan allowed!

##SIDE TOURNAMENT:

We will have a side tournament on one of the arcade games. No cost apart from paying to play the game which is 50 cents - all proceeds go to side tournament prize pool. details are TBD

##FOOD: 

We're firing up the BBQ! We'll be serving hot dogs for 2$ from 5:45 - 6:45! If u wanna go fancy smancy, we are probably doing organic smokies as well for $4.
