Starting September 8th at 3PM, Local Vancouver pinball player [Eden Stamm](http://www.ifpapinball.com/player.php?p=59) played 40 hours of marathon pinball, in an attempt to break the guiness world record for pinball marathon (previously 28 hours)
We captured it on video, to submit to Guiness.

The entire 40 hours gets a little dull, so here's two 6 minute timelapses from some of the cameras.
