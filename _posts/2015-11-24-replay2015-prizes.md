## Finals

We are nearing the end of the fall 2015 season of Replay, and with it League Finals approaches. 

Finals will take place **Wednesday December 9th, 7PM** at the Lamplighter.

The top 16 players qualify for finals. In the event that a qualified player does not attend, the next highest qualified player will be considered qualified. 

Players will play in rounds of 4 player matches, initial seeding by league performance. Each round will eliminate 2 players from each group. 
The number of games each round will increase as we approach the final winners. Scoring per game will be 4/2/1/0

If neccessary, ties for making the finals cut will be resolved by head to head play starting at 6:30 on the 9th. 
Ties affecting only seeding will be resolved arbitrarily.
