title: Replay 2015 - Time Change

As was mentioned at last weeks event - Starting Sept. 30th, we'll be starting league matches at **6:30** instead of **7**.


Most people usually seem to be there by 6:30, but to be a bit flexible, if you're going to cut it close on making it on time (ie: 6:45 or earlier), you can email [replay@lytfyre.net](mailto:replay@lytfyre.net) your full name, by 6:30, and I will make sure you are registered.


We're still hoping to increase the number of machines, but this is a quick change we can make to get the finish times more reasonable.


Hopefully this is more accommodating to people's schedules.


Also coming up on the 30th, [Wizard Mode](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/wizard-mode-a-documentary), the Documentary about Robert Gagno, will be [celebrating the launch of their crowdfunding campaign](https://www.facebook.com/events/555405027944894/) during the night. 

There will be special pinball-related prizes available by donation. 

If you are interested in supporting the film, see their [crowdfunding page](http://igg.me/at/wizardmodefilm).
